Confirmation of a model .

Previous work of ours has demonstrated that a significant amount of natural killer ( NK ) activity variance after surgery in stage I and II breast cancer patients could be accounted for by both the estrogen receptor ( ER ) status of the tumor and by social factors , namely , perceived social support and seeking social support as a general coping strategy .

As considerable evidence has accumulated that social support in both animal and human populations may have survival value , we sought to test the reliability of this regression model , using coping and perceived support factor values obtained at 3 months after surgery to account for concurrent follow - up NK activity in this serially assessed group of patients .

If , as the literature suggests , NK activity is relevant to breast cancer control , and since ER - tumors have a worse prognosis , we suggest here that perhaps such tumors are resistant to control by NK cells because they lack the ability to attract an accumulation of effector cells to the tumor site , or because blocking factors at the site of the tumor prevent local tumor control at the site of action .
